To create a mobile app Preview, you need to add [Quill Previews GitHub Action](https://github.com/quilldevtools/preview)
to your repositoryâ€™s GitHub workflow file. This will automate the generation of PR previews. Follow these steps:

### 1. Add the API key of your Quill workspace to your GitHub Secrets

In order to upload mobile app file to Quill, you will need an API key. To get your API key:

1. Navigate to the settings page of the workspace you'd like to post previews to
2. Locate the "Api Key" section
3. Click the copy icon beside the API key to copy it
   ![Copy API key](../../.github/copy-api-key.png)
4. Go to your repository on GitHub and click on "Settings" at the top of the page
   ![GitHub Settings Button](../../.github/github-repo-settings-btn.png)
5. Under "Secrets and Variables", click on "Actions"
   ![Actions Button](../../.github/actions-secrets-button.png)
6. Click on the "New Repository Secret" button
   ![New Repository Secret Button](../../.github/new-repository-secret.png)
7. Name your secret `QUILL_API_KEY`. Paste the API key from your Quill workspace in the "Secret" text box then click
   the "Add Secret" button

### 2. Create a Workflow File

Create a file `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` and add the following code depending on the type of Android
application you are building:

- [Native Android Application](#native-android-application)
- [Flutter Application](#flutter-application)
- [React Native Application](#react-native-application)

This workflow will run whenever a pull request is made. Remember to replace "com.example"
with your app's actual package name

#### Native Android Application

```yaml
name: Build Android Application
# Controls when the workflow will run. It is recommended to run it when a pull request is
# opened and when the pull request code is updated (synchronized)
on:
  # This will enable the creation of no-code UI tests for your mobile app.
  # Tests are created against the latest app on the main branch
  push:
    branches:
      - "main" # Change to the name of your main branch as needed

  # This gives you mobile app previews for your pending Pull Request changes
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    branches:
      - "main" # Change to the name of your main branch as needed

permissions:
  pull-requests: write # Needed to add comments to the Pull Request that triggered the build
  actions: write # Needed to cancel a workflow when it no longer needs to run
  contents: read # So GitHub can checkout the code and build the app

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

### 3. Create a Pull Request with the new workflow file

Once you create the new workflow file, create a new Pull request with that change. You should see a GitHub action
running a few seconds after the Pull Request is created. You can click on "Details" to monitor the run. If you encounter
any build failures, feel free to chat with us on our Slack channel here:
https://join.slack.com/t/quillchat/shared_invite/zt-2ush8qc0l-fx3EKLnXIYFldoNpt61WbQ

![Github Action Details](../../.github/github-action-details.png)

That's it! You're now set up with Quill. You can also [link your Quill workspace to Slack](/integrating-slack)
