Quill allows seamless integration with tools your team already uses:

- **Slack:**

  - In the _Settings_ tab, navigate to **Slack Integration**.
  - Follow the OAuth flow to connect your Slack workspace.
  - Youâ€™ll be able to receive notifications for PR updates directly in Slack.

- **JIRA:** (Coming Soon)
  - Quill will soon allow you to create and track issues in JIRA without leaving the platform.
